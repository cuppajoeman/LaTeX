### OOP

* Abstraction
  * Making it simpler (only the essential)
* Encapsulation 
  * Reduce cognitive load for others 
* Inheritance
  * So you don't have to re-implement
* Polymorphism
  * Calling the same class on different types my result in a different outcome.

#### New Concepts
* Coupling
  * How similar classes are
    * High - Changes in a class leads to changes in another
    * For example a linked list and a node are highly coupled, it doesn't make sense to have one without the other.

* Cohesion
  * How much of the features belong together
    * High - these classes have stronly related tasks
    * Low - classes do unrelated tasks

### Design Principles
#### SOLID

#### Random Java Facts I picked up
* final means a constant
* static exists outside of the object and can be accessed anywhere
* private - instance variable only used inside the parenthesis
* protected type means it can only be accessed by ay code in the same package
* You have to specify types for everything
* When writing android apps R is a class that is all the UI/XML stuff
* Use camel case for variables.

#### Example from class
* Make a class called Example and then we have subclasses that are for while, if, switch then we create a dictionary and connect the constant to object, then call the method from that.
