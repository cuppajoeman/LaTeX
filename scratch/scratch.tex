To follow the advice given in the reading, we should try to make use of double counting, consider the following shape.

We can think of these as the corners of our new octahedron so we place 8 of these shapes together, though between every two triangles, we have an overlapping square therefore we double counted. 

Thus the total number of gray squares is \(\frac{8 \cdot 4}{2}= 12\), we observe that the white squares are just the sides of a regular cube and so there are 6 of them, and we still have 8 triangles from the original shape. So the transformed octa
