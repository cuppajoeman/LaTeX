    From our tutorial we were given the linear transformation 
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{C}\left(\vec{x}\right) = \vec{0}
    \end{equation*}
    And that the rank of $\mathcal{C}$ was $0$. I was a bit confused by this as the range is the set
    \[
    \left\{ \vec{0} \right\}
    \]
    And a basis for that set is 
    \[
    \left\{ \vec{0} \right\}
    \]
    and the size of that set is 1 so shouldn't the dimension be $1 \Leftrightarrow$ range is 1?
